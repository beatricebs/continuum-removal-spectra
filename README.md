### Description

This repository is supplementary material for the manuscript "Visible-Near Infrared spectral behavior of Mars-analog clays, sulfate, and basalt mixtures" by Baschetti et al., currently under publication in the journal Icarus.

The python scripts reported here perform continuum removal (CR) on isolated bands of intimate spectral mixtures (binary and ternary) and endmembers of clay, sulfate, and basalt samples. In addition, we compute on each isolated band the band area (BA), band depth (BD), and band centre (BC). 

### Tested with 

Python 3.12.0\
NumPy version: 1.26.4\
Matplotlib version: 3.8.2\
Seaborn version: 0.13.2

Original data is fully available in the "Data" folder in this repository.

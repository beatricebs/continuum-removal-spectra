### Description

These python scripts perform continuum removal (CR) on isolated bands of spectral mixtures (binary and ternary) and endmembers. In addition, we compute on each isolated band band area (BA), band depth (BD), and band centre (BC). 

### Tested with 

Python 3.12.0\
NumPy version: 1.26.4\
Matplotlib version: 3.8.2\
Seaborn version: 0.13.2
